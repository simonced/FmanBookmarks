# FmanBookmarks
Make a list of important folders to come back to them later.

Yes, there is `Ctrl+P` to go back to recently accessed locations, but this list changes and the order of items as well.

I find that having a fixed list also has the merit to be scrollable in case we forget where we put things.  
I do the same with my most edited files in Emacs, it's more a habit than anything.

Each bookmark can be named because sometimes, the target path are similar.  
(I have cases like php.ini5.4, php.ini7.1 etc...)

## Defaults

Shortcuts:

- `Ctrl+B` : list bookmarks
- `Ctrl+Shift+B` : add current pane directory in bookmarks

# TODO

Things I'll try to add if I feel it is really needed.

- Add a way to remove a bookmark.
